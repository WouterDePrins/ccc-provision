# ccc-provision

This repository contains the source code & model of a simple 3-tier Cisco Cloudcenter Suite deployment that I've created. The readme.md also explains all the steps I took to get to this solution.

## tl;dr

If you just want to deploy this application yourself, set up your cloud(s) by going to admin --> clouds in the workload manager. Next, download the threetier.zip file, go to "App profiles" and import it by clicking IMPORT. Finally, you can go to Deployments --> new deployment and follow the GUI. When your application is in the "deployed" state, you can "access application" and start using it.
